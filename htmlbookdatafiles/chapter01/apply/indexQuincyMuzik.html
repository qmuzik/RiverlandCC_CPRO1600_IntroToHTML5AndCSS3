	<p>In order to plan a website there are many steps that must be followed in order to start. First step, your must think about the websites purpose and who will be its target audience. Second step, make sure the webpage can be viewed on multiple platforms such as desktops or mobile devices such as cell phones and tablets. Third step, you must make a site map and think about its wireframe. Fourth step, make the website have some beautiful graphics, an appropriate color pallet and has a readable font scheme.

Those steps will allow you to plan and hopefully create a successful website. </p>
	
	<p>In Chapter 1, there are many new items I learned, however I will only be covering two of those items. First item I learned, is that in order to start building a website, you must plan what your website to look like and how it will function. Second item I learned is that by using CSS and Javascript you can make your website more distinguishing and increase its functionality with all its webpages. </p>
